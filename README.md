# raycasting-exercise

This project was coded using JavaScript and the p5.js library from https://p5js.org/

It performs simple raycasting in order to navigate a space, imitating a very basic concept of self-navigating tech. 

The environment is generated with marching squares built from 3D perlin noise.
